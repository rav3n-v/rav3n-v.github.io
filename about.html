<h2>Welcome to My Site</h2>

<p>Hey! I’m Vinayak D, currently pursuing my MSc in Mathematics at Cochin University of Science and Technology.
I love math, coding, and sharing what I learn along the way.
 This site is where I explore ideas, post projects, and maybe figure out what I’m meant to do. Feel free to reach out at <a id="email" href="mailto:vinayak02003@gmail.com">vinayak02003@gmail.com</a> or connect with me on my socials. :)</p>
